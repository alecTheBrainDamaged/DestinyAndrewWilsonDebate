In fact Destiny even agrees taht such rioting and political violence is part of the democratic process akin 
to voting he says. 
He said this to justify the George Floyd or blm riots that such riots were just one side of the democrat coin 
and baked into our democrat process, the tails end at just the other half of democracy he says. 
Of course, he later denied this, please play clip two. 

-- Destiny and what he says in clip 2 I omit for now. 

Andrew : Whoof, so why the radical change of heart in this topic from Destiny? This complete 180? Well that's simple. 
He hates Domanld Trump. A simple motivation but at least understandable. 
He also hates Trump supporters. In order for him to justify that he wants them all to be unalived he needs 
to brand them all as traitors and insurrectionists.  In this way he can build a case that Trump supporters are evil, and 
so it is justified to use violence against them. To recap that, Trump supporters are evil therefore anything 
which happens to them is fine. 
Going so far to say his friend Pisco, his Jewish friend Pisco, the only reason he wouldn't of liked Trump to have been 
unalived by this would be assasin is because it would motivate Republicans, this of course gives us an entailment 
that if it wouldn't motivate Trump supporters he would be fine with Trump having met his demise in thi sassassination attempt, 
and this is th elast clip , play clip three please. 
-- Plays clip three of Destiny.
